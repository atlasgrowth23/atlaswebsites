**Evaluating Next.js Error**

I think the user is dealing with a Next.js error related to a missing `_document.js`. This could happen if they don't have a custom `_document.tsx`, or the build is incomplete. Next.js creates a custom document if needed, but this specific error suggests it's missing. It could also be linked to them using the pages directory with a build issue or an app directory misconfiguration. Running in development might regenerate the missing file if the build cleaned up.

**Error Explanation for Missing \_document.js**

The user seems to be facing an error where Next.js is looking for a missing `_document.js`. This might happen if they've manually removed `.next` or moved `_document.tsx` to the app directory, causing the build not to generate a custom Document file. Without a defined custom document, Next.js falls back to its default Document, but some setup issues might require an explicit file. This can happen if `next export` is used or if the build scripts aren't correctly setting up the file structure.


Thought for 9 seconds


That error is coming straight from Next’s page loader: it’s trying to read the compiled output for your custom (or default) Document component at

```
.next/server/pages/_document.js
```

and can’t find it, so it throws ENOENT.

### Why that file should exist

* **Pages Router**: Next will compile a `pages/_document.tsx` (or `.js`) into `.next/server/pages/_document.js`.
* **Default Document**: Even if you don’t supply one, Next has a built‑in default Document that it still emits into `.next/server/pages/_document.js` during dev/build.

### Why it’s missing

1. **Build didn’t run cleanly** — if an earlier syntax error or misconfig in your `package.json` prevented `.next` from generating, that file never got written.
2. **You removed or mis‑named** a `pages/_document.tsx` (or `.js`) so Next’s fallback didn’t fire.
3. **Using App Router only** — if you deleted `pages/` and only have an `app/` directory, you don’t need `_document` anymore, but some code (or an import) in `pages/` is still telling Next to look for it.

## How to fix it

1. **If you’re on the Pages router**, create a minimal custom Document so Next will emit that file:

   ```tsx
   // pages/_document.tsx
   import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

   export default function Document() {
     return (
       <Html>
         <Head />
         <body>
           <Main />
           <NextScript />
         </body>
       </Html>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Clear out and restart** your build:

   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **If you’ve migrated fully to the App Router**, remove any leftover `pages/` imports or references so Next doesn’t try to load `_document.js`. Instead rely on `app/layout.tsx` for global HTML `<head>` and `<body>` wrappers.

Once you either restore a `_document.tsx` or ensure you’re purely on the App Router, Next will generate (or stop looking for) `.next/server/pages/_document.js` and the ENOENT will go away.
