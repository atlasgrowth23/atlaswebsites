**Identifying image source issue**

The user is seeing an error about an invalid `src` assignment ("Yes") in their code related to `<Image>`. I suspect it's from a conditional rendering inside a component like `Header.tsx` or `Hero.tsx`, where `logo_url` is being replaced with "Yes." It looks like they might have mistakenly replaced a default path with a string instead of leaving a proper image URL. I’ll need to point them to the specific file and code snippet where this occurs so they can correct it.


**Identifying source of error**

The error appears because the code is assigning "Yes" as the `src` in the `<Image>` component. This is likely happening in either `Header.tsx` or `Hero.tsx`, where the code might be using a fallback like this:

```jsx
<Image src={logoUrl ?? "Yes"} ... />
```

The problem is that "Yes" is being passed as a string instead of a valid image source. The user should check these files to fix the issue. We won’t need to inspect the entire repo directly, just the specific snippets.


**Identifying incorrect fallback in image path**

In the code, `Hero.tsx` seems to have a typo for the image `src`. It’s using `"Yes"` as the fallback instead of a valid image URL:

```jsx
<Image
  src={logoUrl ? logoUrl : "Yes"} // wrong fallback
  alt={`${companyName} logo`}
  width={150}
  height={100}
/>
```

This is causing Next.js to try to load the string "Yes" instead of an image. The issue may be in the `Header.tsx` or `Hero.tsx` files, where the fallback is misconfigured, leading to the error. Check these files for the faulty code.

This particular error—

```
Error: Failed to parse src "Yes" on `next/image`…
```

is coming from the **`<Image>`** component in your HVAC template that’s using the literal string `"Yes"` as the fallback `src`. Next.js interprets `"Yes"` as a relative path (which doesn’t start with `/`) and not a valid URL, so it throws.

## Which file and snippet to look at

You’ll find it in your **Header** (or possibly your **Hero**) component under:

```
components/templates/TemplateHVAC1/Header.tsx
```

*(or if you added a similar fallback in Hero, then in Hero.tsx)*

Look for a line that looks like this:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong: passing "Yes" as the image source
<Image
  src={logoUrl ?? "Yes"}
  alt={`${companyName} logo`}
  width={150}
  height={50}
/>
```

Or in Hero:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong: passing "Yes" as the background image
<Image
  src={heroImageUrl || "Yes"}
  alt="Hero background"
  fill
  className="object-cover"
/>
```

---

## The fix

Replace that `"Yes"` fallback with a real path (either a local `/public` file or a full URL). For example, in **Header.tsx**:

```diff
- <Image
-   src={logoUrl ?? "Yes"}
+ <Image
+   src={logoUrl ?? "/images/default-logo.png"}
    alt={`${companyName} logo`}
    width={150}
    height={50}
  />
```

And in **Hero.tsx** (if you did the same there):

```diff
- <Image
-   src={heroImageUrl || "Yes"}
+ <Image
+   src={heroImageUrl || "/images/default-hero.jpg"}
    alt="Hero background"
    fill
    className="object-cover"
  />
```

### How to find it in your code

You can grep for the literal string `"Yes"`:

```bash
grep -R '["'\'']Yes["'\'']' components/templates/TemplateHVAC1
```

That will point you directly to the file and line number.

Once you’ve changed those fallbacks to valid paths, the **`next/image`** errors will disappear.
