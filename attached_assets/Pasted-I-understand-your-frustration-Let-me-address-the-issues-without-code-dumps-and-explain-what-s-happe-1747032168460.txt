I understand your frustration. Let me address the issues without code dumps and explain what's happening:

The current implementation has several significant problems:

1. **Authentication**: The portal is bypassing actual authentication. When you access `/hvacportal/dashboard` directly, it shows the dashboard without verifying your identity. This is a major security issue - there's no real authentication happening.

2. **Auto-login**: The login form is automatically submitting instead of waiting for you to click the login button, which feels rushed and doesn't give users control.

3. **Business identity**: The dashboard doesn't show which business is logged in, making it unclear which account you're viewing.

4. **Schema page**: It's cluttered with unnecessary functionality for adding tables when all you want is a simple view of what currently exists in your database.

Here's what needs to happen:

For the portal login:
- Remove the auto-submission of the form
- Make the user click the login button manually
- Implement proper authentication that actually verifies credentials

For the dashboard:
- Display the business name prominently at the top
- Pull business-specific data based on the logged-in account
- Make it clear which business account is being viewed

For the schema page:
- Simplify to only show existing tables and columns
- Remove all the table creation buttons and functionality
- Focus solely on displaying what's currently in your database

Regarding Supabase authentication, it's not working properly because the implementation isn't connecting to Supabase's auth system correctly. The current code appears to be simulating authentication rather than actually using Supabase's auth capabilities.

The dashboard needs to:
1. Check if a user is authenticated
2. Retrieve the business_slug associated with that user
3. Display business-specific information based on that slug

Let Repl.it's agent know to completely rebuild these pages with these requirements in mind, without all the unnecessary clutter. The focus should be on proper authentication, business-specific displays, and simplicity.
