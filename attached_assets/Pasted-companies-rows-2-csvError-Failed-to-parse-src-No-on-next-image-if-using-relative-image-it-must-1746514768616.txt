So just how you see it... ...is exactly how it is in my database. The first thing that I want to work out is why I keep fucking saying for almost all the businesses really the things that aren't doing it are Arctic Eating and Cooling and Jim Brown Company. So I just shared with you the snippet that I get for the rest of them when it fails. I mean, we've been over it a lot. Why are these working and all the other ones fail? Tell me. Because I've told you several times, and you just haven't done it.
