Look at these logs please and I want you to take out how it goes to that dashboard page that's not a page anymore when you first go on. It should just go to the pipeline and then also look at the analytics page please and templates page. The analytics page I just want to take out for now because it's not... The templates page is right underneath that so to speak. It's unnecessary and not up to date. But the one thing I know that you need is the... it has to be buttoned. It has to have a name and that whole... the whole process of doing that is maybe the most important thing I think. So where it has to be though is on the pipeline here. I don't know. I just click the button here. Click on there and it has the template. I'm not sure if it has something like... well, basically the whole process is doing the business client, the domain, and I buy one form and connect this new domain to their domain, that's template. And on this page, the icon next to the template, analytics, this is now going to be broken if you do this kind of thing. So in this case, what I want you to do is take out the first page, take out the... Yeah, take out the first part and then summarize everything. Doing it so you confirm with me you know how it works.
