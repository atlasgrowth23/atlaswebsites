Okay, so... The schema is... Actually accurate for the COMPANIES table. However, it's showing tables that do not exist in my superbase tables yet. Like, for example, the ChatMessages and ChatConfigurations. I don't see that in my superbase. However, I don't even need that. Or I do need that maybe, but I just want the schema to show, like, what is currently there so that we can build it out, the rest of this application, where you know how to link it, right? Because if you don't know what is currently there, we can't edit the database. And basically, what I want... Or, I guess also, we had these ears.TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
