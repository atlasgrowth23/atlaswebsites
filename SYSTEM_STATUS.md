# Cold Call Pipeline System - Current Status

## **System Overview**
Complete cold call session tracking system with automated pipeline progression, activity logging, and session analytics.

## **Pipeline Stages (Option B - Implemented)**
```
1. New Lead â†’ Ready to contact
2. Live Call â†’ Answer Call Snippet sent (talked to them)
3. Voicemail â†’ Voicemail snippets sent (left voicemail)
4. Site Viewed â†’ They visited the website (auto-triggered)
5. Appointment â†’ Manual button
6. Sale Made â†’ Manual button
7. Unsuccessful â†’ Red button (existing)
```

## **Auto-Stage Transitions (Working)**
- `New Lead` â†’ `Live Call` (when Answer Call Snippet sent)
- `New Lead` â†’ `Voicemail` (when Voicemail Part 1 sent)
- `Live Call`/`Voicemail` â†’ `Site Viewed` (when website visited)
- Any stage â†’ `Unsuccessful` (manual button)

## **Activity Tracking (Implemented)**
```javascript
// All actions tracked in activity_log table:
PREVIEW_WEBSITE: 'preview_website'
VIEW_GOOGLE_REVIEWS: 'view_google_reviews'
CALL_STARTED: 'call_started'
SMS_ANSWER_CALL: 'sms_answer_call_sent'
SMS_VOICEMAIL_1: 'sms_voicemail_1_sent'
SMS_VOICEMAIL_2: 'sms_voicemail_2_sent'
OWNER_NAME_ADDED: 'owner_name_added'
OWNER_EMAIL_ADDED: 'owner_email_added'
NOTE_ADDED: 'note_added'
TEMPLATE_SAVED: 'template_saved'
UNSUCCESSFUL_CALL: 'unsuccessful_call_marked'
APPOINTMENT_SET: 'appointment_set'
SALE_MADE: 'sale_made'
CALLBACK_RECEIVED: 'callback_received'
```

## **Session Management (Working)**
- Start/end sessions via `/admin/sessions` page
- Real-time session controls in pipeline header
- Session stats: leads_processed, calls_made, contacts_made, voicemails_left
- Activity tracking with session_id context

## **UI Components Status**

### **LeadSidebar Quick Actions:**
âœ… Call button (always visible)
âœ… Unsuccessful call button (active session only)
âœ… Preview website button (always visible)
âœ… Google reviews button (always visible)
âœ… Manual actions dropdown (Set Appointment, Mark Sale, Callback)

### **Tabs:**
âœ… Overview - business info, review analytics
âœ… Notes - owner name/email, notes with types
âœ… Activity - timeline of all actions
âœ… SMS - snippets with tracking
âœ… Site Analytics - website visit data
âœ… Template - customization editor

## **Database Tables**
```sql
-- Session tracking
cold_call_sessions (id, user_name, start_time, end_time, leads_processed, calls_made, contacts_made, voicemails_left)

-- Activity logging
activity_log (id, session_id, lead_id, company_id, user_name, action, action_data, created_at)

-- Pipeline management
lead_pipeline (id, company_id, stage, notes, created_at, updated_at)

-- Website analytics (existing)
template_views (id, company_id, session_id, visitor_id, total_time_seconds, visit_start_time, visit_end_time, is_return_visitor)
```

## **Call End Detection (Current Logic)**
Call ends when:
- Owner email added (successful call)
- Owner name changed 
- Note added
- Unsuccessful call button clicked

## **Still To Do**
ðŸ”„ **Tags System** - auto tags (answered-call, voicemail-left, viewed-during-call) + manual tags
ðŸ”„ **Comprehensive API Testing** - edge cases, concurrent sessions, error scenarios
ðŸ”„ **Call End Trigger Refinement** - more robust detection
ðŸ”„ **Test Company Setup** - Jared, grandmother numbers for real testing

## **API Endpoints (Working)**
```
/api/sessions - GET sessions, POST start/end
/api/sessions/start - POST start session
/api/sessions/end - POST end session
/api/sessions/[sessionId]/activities - GET session activities
/api/activity/track - POST track activity
/api/activity/lead/[leadId] - GET lead activities
/api/analytics/track - POST website visit (auto-stages to site_viewed)
/api/pipeline/leads - GET pipeline data
/api/pipeline/move-lead - POST stage changes
```

## **User Workflow (Tested)**
1. Start session
2. Click business card â†’ opens LeadSidebar
3. Preview website (tracked)
4. View Google reviews (tracked)
5. Click call button (tracked)
6. If answer: Send answer call snippet â†’ auto-stage to Live Call
7. If no answer: Wait 5s, call again, send voicemail snippets â†’ auto-stage to Voicemail
8. Add owner email/notes (ends call window)
9. If they visit website â†’ auto-stage to Site Viewed
10. Manual actions via dropdown (Appointment, Sale, Callback)
11. End session

## **Integration Points**
- Pipeline header shows active session with real-time duration
- Session controls in pipeline (start/end buttons)
- Activity tracking connects to sessions for analytics
- Website analytics auto-updates pipeline stages
- Manual actions update both activities and stages

## **Next Phase**
Focus on tags system implementation and stress testing with real phone numbers.
